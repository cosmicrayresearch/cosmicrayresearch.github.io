  <div class = "panel-body">
    <p>
      In 2003 an initiative was presented for the development of a series of clusters of detectors around Dutch academic institutions for the purpose of education and research. The High School Project on Astrophysics Research with Cosmics (HiSPARC) was born. Now, the initiative has over 150 detector stations across Europe.
      Based in Marling School, we are one of these stations. We have divided up in to two groups, which you can read about in their individual group pages, to do genuine research about topics we enjoy.

  <h2>Cosmic Ray Explanation</h2>
  </div>
  <div class = "panel-body">
  <p>
    The name "cosmic rays" can be quite misleading as they are not rays and in fact are fast moving charged particles originating from space.
  
    <br>
    When they hit the atmosphere they break down into smaller particles. The magnetic fields of 
    earth affects cosmic rays so they often spiral around the magnetic field close to the north and south poles. 
    When this happens, some of the particles ionise the atmosphere, which then recombine with electrons, causing light. 
    This causes a spiral of multi-coloured lights known as the aurorae which are the Aurora Borealis (The northern lights) 
    and the Aurora Australis (The south pole)
    <br>
    This picture shows how cosmic rays break down as they enter the atmosphere:
    <br>
    <img src="img/Cosmic%20ray%20decomposition.jpg" align = "left" alt = "Cosmic ray decomposition" id="cosmicraydecomposition">
    <br>
    Muons are the only particles that reach ground level and as such are the ones we detect.
  </p>
  <h4>Further explanation of cosmic rays.</h4>
  <h4><small>Pions</small></h4>
  <p>
    Pions are any one of these three subatomic particles:
    <br>
    &pi;<sup>0</sup> (Neutral), &pi;<sup>+</sup> (Positive) or &pi;<sup>-</sup> (Negative)
    <br>
    They consist of a quark and an antiquark
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4><small>Photons</small></h4>
  <p>
    Photons are elementary particles which are the main form of all electromagnetic radiation, including light.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4><small>Muons</small></h4>
  <p>
    Muons are elementary particles similar to electrons with a negative charge and a high mass.
  </p>
  <h4>How does the cosmic ray detector work?</h3>
  <p>
    The magic behind the detectors are the scintillating plates inside of them. The material they are made of creates a flash of light when it is hit by quick enough particles.
    The light intensity in dependent on the amount of energy given off by the charged particle.
    The light is picked up by a photomultiplier tube which turns it into a electrical signal.
    it is then stored on a program on the computer so we can analyse it.
    The number of particles that hit the detector per second is very high but, because we are only interested in the particles that come from a shower (therefore from the same cosmic 
    ray breaking up), we use multiple plates (0.5m<sup>2</sup> each) a few metres apart and make it a requirement that both plates must detect at the same time, as particles from 
    the same shower arrive earth at almost the exact same time.
    By correlating and analysing the data from various stations, we can see showers that extend of hundreds of square kilometres.

    <h4>What are we doing?</h4>
    <p>
        As a group we are looking for a link in the activity of solar weather, and the number of cosmic rays that reach Earth.<br>
        We are looking at data collected from our own detector as well as many others, and are collecting data on many different types of solar weather such as solar wind, coronal mass ejections, and sunspots.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Analysing data</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        When we were looking at data for the actvity of solar wind (a type of solar weather) one member of our team (Laurence Dhonau) came up with a spreadsheet to help us analyse it.
        You can download it <a href = "Solar%20Wind%20and%20Cosmic%20Ray%20Data%20Comparison.xlsm" id = "spreadsheet"> here.</a>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4><small>How to use it?</small></h4>
    <p>
        You can automatically update the data by pressing the button that says "Update Cosmic Ray Data"<br>
    </p>
    <img src = "img/update%20cosmic%20ray%20data.JPG" style = "max-width:50%;" alt = "Image of Update Cosmic Ray Data Button">
    <br>
    <p>
        which gathers the data directly from hisparc.
        You can look at the data from a particular day by entering a date to match the date from the solar wind file
        In order to see the solar wind data, you need a certain type of file, such as <a href = "ftp://ftp.swpc.noaa.gov/pub/lists/ace2/201607_ace_swepam_1h.txt"> this one</a> or <a href = "ftp://ftp.swpc.noaa.gov/pub/lists/ace/ace_swepam_1m.txt">this one.</a>
        <br>
        Then you just have to press the button that says "Update Solar Wind Data"

        and it would then plot it against a graph.

      <h4>What are we doing?</h4>
      <p>
        As a group we are looking to see if we can track the origins of the solar rays. We are looking for coincidences across detectors across the world as well as our own and are calculating the angle of the rays, letting us find the origin.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h4>Analysing data</h4>
      In order to find the angle of the ray, a member of our team (Tom Green) has created software that allows us to choose a station and look for coincidences and then calculate the angles of the ray.
